//! Library crate to assist in managing local robot maps in the domain of multi-robot coverage tasks.
//!
//! Robots generally need information about the environment they operate in, and maps are a simple way to store this information. The case being made here is more specifically on multi-robot exploration where one tries to obtain full area coverage. However, care is being put into ensuring that the implemenation can generalize to adjacent disciplines outside of terrain mapping (i.e. perform full map coverage, determine resource concentrations, etc.)
//!
//! The aim is to use this library in a decentralized setting, hence the *local* part in the name. Each robot should hold its own version of the map, upon which it can make decisions. Synchronizing of the maps across robots is outside the scope of this library; this one merely provides a basis on which to get started.
